# COMM-school-Data_Analytics
My final project for my Data Analytics trainings course
#####
During intensive one month training I experienced in PowerBI and MSSQL. Here I attach my final project work for which I explored interesting public datasets.
First dataset was about Air Polution in Seoul, which was quite big so I make mind to analyze only for year of 2019.
Second dataset was about shooting cases in USA.
Considering importance of this datasets it was easy and comfortable to find different trends, tell story and present knowledge frow raw data .
Its worth to mention that this experience gave me a pretty enought knowledge how works data analytics cycle at all, and I hope to use this skill regularly.
