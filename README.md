# COMM-school-Data_Analytics
My final project for my Data Analytics trainings course
#####
During intensive one-month training, I experienced PowerBI and MSSQL. Here I attach my final project work for which I explored interesting public datasets. The first dataset was about Air Pollution in Seoul, which was quite big so I make up my mind to analyze only for the year 2019. The second dataset was about shooting cases in the USA. Considering the importance of these datasets it was easy and comfortable to find different trends, tell stories, and present knowledge from raw data. It's worth mentioning that this experience gave me pretty enough knowledge of how works data analytics cycle all, and I hope to use this skill regularly.
